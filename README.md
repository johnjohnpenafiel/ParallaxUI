# ParallaxUI üåê

**ParallaxUI** is a graphical user interface designed to help developers and users with basic programming knowledge create customizable objects that feature dynamic parallax effects. Through an intuitive and modern interface, users can create objects with multiple layers that move at different speeds based on mouse hover or animation, adding depth and a 3D-like experience. After completing their design, users can export the generated code to integrate the object into their own projects or websites.

## Progress

The user interface has been significantly upgraded from previous versions, offering enhanced customization options for creating parallax layers. The improvements include:

- A refined user interface with two dedicated sidebars: one for managing layers and another for configuring design settings.
- Support for both dark and light modes.
- The ability to add layers of depth to the parallax design, making it more visually dynamic.
- Expanded customization options for creating unique and compelling designs.

While there is still more work to be done, the next major focus will be on enabling users to export the generated code, making it reusable in their own projects. This will mark the completion of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), allowing future development to focus on creating a more dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Objects:**

  - Users can create and customize objects by adjusting parameters such as height, width, color, and adding text.
  - Users can also add images, icons, and other media to the objects for a more personalized design.

- **Parallax Effects:**

  - Objects can have multiple layers (e.g., background, middle, and foreground) that move at different speeds to create a parallax effect.
  - Layers respond dynamically to mouse hover or animations, creating a sense of depth.

- **Real-Time Code Export:**

  - After designing the object, users can export the corresponding code and use it in their own projects.
  - The code is optimized and ready for direct implementation into web-based projects.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - The interface is designed to be intuitive and modern, with a focus on providing a seamless experience similar to tools like Canva or Figma.
  - Real-time previews ensure that users can see their changes immediately.

## Current State

- **Basic Customization:**
  - Users can adjust height, width, and add text or images to the object.
  - Basic export functionality is available to console log the code.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Customization:**

  - Ability to add multiple layers to an object with independent controls for each layer's dimensions, colors, and effects.
  - Support for additional customization options, such as gradients, shadow effects, and animation presets.

- **Refined Code Export:**

  - Improve the export feature to allow users to easily download or copy the generated code, with options for different formats (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS).

- **Enhanced UI/UX Design:**
  - Further development of the graphical interface to allow more customization and a more user-friendly design.
  - Improved responsiveness and support for various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - React.js
  - TypeScript

- **Styling:**

  - MaterialUI

- **Backend (Future):**
  - Ruby on Rails (for saving projects, user authentication, etc.)

## Target Audience

ParallaxUI is designed primarily for developers or users with basic programming knowledge who want a quick and easy way to create parallax-based designs. With its user-friendly interface, it also caters to users who are less experienced with coding but want to experiment with web design.
